                heliconias, bananas, tropical vines, tropical shrubs, plumerias, tropical fruiting plants and trees and
                so much more. We are constantly searching and hunting for rare,new and the most up to date varieties of

        <article id="palms">
            <h1>Palm Trees</h1>
            <p>We grow 800 different species of palms that will grow in Southern California. This includes smaller and
                larger plants that you've never seen anywhere! There are plants for sun and shade. And, plants that stay
                small or get large. We specialize in plants that you'll not find in the "Big Box Stoes" so that your
                garden can be unique and different. These include dwarf sun loving species and desert palms. We also
                have a great selection of shade loving palms, both dwarf species and tall, bamboo type palms. We offer
                over 800 species of palms in a whole assortment of sizes. You can search far and wide and nowhere will
                you see the same variety we offer on a daily basis. </p>

        <article id="cycads">
            <h1>Cycads</h1>
            <p>We grow cycads from seeds but also, over the years, have imported many exciting species as actual plants
                or caudexes. Cycads are the most coveted, protected and historically significant plants that exist on
                this planet. They have evolved little since the time of the dinasaurs. We actively purchase domestic
                collections. All this results in our offering to you species that you've probably never seen before. You
                no longer have to be content with the common Sago Palm. We have plants of all sizes and appearances,
                something right for everyone's budget. Included in our inventory are the very sought after blue African
                Cycads. Interesting seedlings are always available. We feel we have the most extensive offering of
                unusual and rare cycads of any nursery. </p>

        <article id="tropicals">
            <h1>Tropical Plants</h1>
            <p>Our nursery attempts to offer customers the finest of colorful tropical plants, especially colorful
                items. This includes typically an assortment of Ti, Heliconia, Bromeliads, Croton, Ferns, Philodendron
                and many other tropical companion plants. </p>
            <p>Many people visit for these plants alone. It is important to realize that many tropical species won't
                grow in all localities of Southern California. We can offer advice as to the types best suited for your
                individual climate and sun exposure. </p>
